title: Do statistics lie? - a case-study on NYC's MTA traffic pattern!
---

I set out to study New York City's MTA (subway) turnstile data to estimate the volume of commuters going in and out of each subway station. There were quite a few interesting patterns in this exploratory analysis leading me to believe that 'data make us lie' and do not blame on statistical methods! Well, that's not something new to us.

Here, I limit my notes to a part of the analysis that tells us a confusing story based on prior common sense knowledge. Let us test our knowledge (hypothesis) on MTA data. 

-- So, hypothesis is: In any part of the world, peak hours would mean 8am - 10am, and 4pm - 7pm.

But, what do you see from these graphs? What insights/patterns can you extract from these graphs?
