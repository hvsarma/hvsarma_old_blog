title: A week went by...!

Things I learnt in a week.
- when challenged with multiple 'stuffs' to do, 'focus' and do 'mvp' (I will hear this probably many times in due course).

- pair programming: is beyond how to program, and what to program! It is about translating an idea clearly and executing it harmoniously!

- 'git'ting & blogging (make it a practice, and make our git contributions green!)

- cool things we could do with public datasets (for learning or even to take it up further for real life projects). I would want to explain this on another page. So, check it out! and feel free to comment (Oops! sorry, Jekyll doesn't allow implementation of Disqus for readers to comment. It works on a minimalist view!)

- overall, a great start to the bootcamp!
